Transgender and nonbinary people are a small yet visible minority in the U.S. Unfortunately, in the current cultural and political landscape, the community is being targeted: According to the American Civil Liberties Union, there are 533 anti- LGBTQ bills moving forward across the United States. These bills often target transgender/nonbinary people in core areas of life including access to safe bathrooms, employment, education and healthcare. What's more, on his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping order dictating that the United States government would only recognize two unchangeable genders. From passport applications being paused, healthcare being called into question, and people fearing for the safety of their families, nonbinary and transgender Americans are filled with more fear and uncertainty than ever right now. On a personal level, I am afraid every time I need to hand anyone my identification — my legal gender is “X” both on my state and federal documents. In 2001, at age 18, I came out as nonbinary/trans and was kicked out of my home for being queer. I found immediate love and acceptance within the LGBTQ+ community. I found my people, I found my home. From my trans community, I learned about our powerful history of resistance and visibility. Just as I was supported, we must continue to support trans people and continue to encourage affirming loud and proud representation of our lives and community. Government recognition and support makes our lives better, but it isn’t what makes us real. We can’t be erased with legislative actions or executive orders. Despite everything happening, we are still here living authentically and loving each other. We might be afraid, but we are also filled with hope. Remember, as dark as these days may feel, we can find rainbows of hope on the other side of this storm. Here are words of support from transgender and nonbinary people, including famous trans actors.
