  "content": "Controversial social media influencer and alleged sex trafficker Andrew Tate trolled an activist sharing a gender-inclusive message Sunday by claiming to be a woman — going as far as changing his bio to say “The Most Googled woman in the world.” Tate was responding to Nina Turner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, who tweeted on Saturday, “If someone says they’re a woman, they’re a woman. Not a tough concept.” “I’m a woman,” Tate replied. In his apparent attempt to rile others up, Tate quote tweeted the message with several shirtless photos of himself doing stereotypically masculine things like smoking a cigar, boxing and flexing his muscles. The former kickboxer and self-proclaimed misogynist then updated his Twitter bio to say “Woman,” before changing it to say, “The Most Googled woman in the world.” He then concluded his trolling post by writing, “Im a lesbian woman so I only use my female penis on other women.” Tate, 36, was released from Romanian prison in April where he was held for three months on rape, sex trafficking and organized crime charges. The poster boy for “toxic masculinity” — who remains under house arrest — also faces rape and abuse allegations from three women who worked for him as webcam models when he lived in the UK from 2013 to 2016. The unnamed women said they wanted to “prove in court that Andrew is abusive, coercive and controlling and that his public statements about women are nothing more than a fantasy.” Tate was released from Romanian prison alongside his brother Tristian and two Romanian women. The two have been accused of running an organized crime gang, in which they seduced and tricked women into sex trafficking, with some alleged victims accusing the brothers of rape. At least six victims have come forward alleging “acts of physical violence and mental coercion” and sexual exploitation. The two Romanian women involved, Naghel Georgiana Manuela and Radu Alexandra Luana, have also been arrested in connection to the alleged crimes. Tate has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence and alleged their case is a political conspiracy designed to silence him. Despite the allegations, he continues to gain hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter, where he currently has over 6 million followers. He was previously banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech. Advertisement Use precise geolocation data.
